### Problem Statement:
Mostly Common Citizens don't about elected politicians or government officials etc. In need, people don't know about their contact info or office information or the proper way to reach them regarding any issue.
People don't know about the current performance of them or the elected government, or any other survey reports about there performance.
After the election citizens can't even rate them or question them or give any opinion about them by using any dedicated platform.
